symbols layout: must have same tile for all the low/mid symbols, as an animation.
symbols 7,8,9: full size characters that get cropped on front end
symbol 10,11 : normal size wild (same symbol for some reason)
symbol 12, beans
frames: just for full size for characters and only 1


backgrounds (can change but side meter must stay in background):
FS, integrated box on desktop and mobile, positions can change from MWJ to remove the side meter from the top on portrait that was not ideal
background number of layers can be different

Side meter, base game (should stay the same)
harp event and animation (harp idle is not used on MWJ too)
each leaf on the side meter has a separate animation and beanstalk is in the background so it should xmas if possible (8 positions)



Side meter, FS (should stay the same)
MWJ didn't have animations on the number , it just made the numbers brighter (6 positions) 
animation to highlight the number of successive wins you're at (green leaves animation)
