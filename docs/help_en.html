<p><b>Blackjack</b></p><p><strong>RTP</strong></p><p>The theoretical RTP for Blackjack based on a perfect strategy is 99.54%</p><p><strong>Cards</strong></p><p></strong>Blackjack</strong>  is played with 6 standard decks of 52 cards (Jokers not included). The cards are re&ndash;shuffled for each game round.</p> <p>Number cards, 2&ndash;10, count as face value. Face cards, kings, queens and jacks, are valued at 10 and aces are valued at either 1 or 11. No particular significance is given to any of the 4 suits.</p> <p>The ultimate aim of Blackjack is to hold a hand value that beats the dealer but without exceeding 21. Play takes place against a computerized dealer. The dealer is dealt two cards, and the player is dealt two cards in each box. The player&apos;s cards are dealt face up, while only the dealer&apos;s first card is shown. A player can choose an additional card by pressing <strong>Hit</strong>. A player may repeat this as many times as they like so long as the total of their cards does not exceed 21. If the total exceeds 21, it is considered a bust and the player automatically loses.</p> <p>Once the player is satisfied with the cards they are holding, they should press <strong>Stand</strong>. This is repeated for all the hands the player is playing. After the player is finished, it is the dealer&apos;s turn to reveal their face down card and decide whether they would like to take another card. The dealer in Blackjack is obliged to play to the following rule: the dealer must stand on any hand value of 17 or above (including &apos;soft&apos; values), and must draw on any hand value below 17.</p> <p>If the value of the player&apos;s cards is greater than the dealer&apos;s, or if the dealer busts then the player is the winner and is paid even odds (1:1).</p> <p>If the player&apos;s card total is the same as the dealers it is considered a push and the player gets to keep their bet.</p> <p><strong>Blackjack</strong></p> <p>If a 10&ndash;value card, the number 10 card or any king, queen or jack, plus an ace is initially dealt in any hand, it is considered Blackjack. The player wins 1.5 times their bet when they are dealt Blackjack. The player automatically loses if the dealer is dealt Blackjack.</p> <p>If both are dealt Blackjack it is considered a push and the player gets their bet back.</p> <p><strong>Insurance</strong></p> <p>If the visible card of the dealer is an ace, the player may buy insurance by betting an additional 0.5 times their initial bet. If the dealer then gets Blackjack, the player will win 2 times their insurance bet. If the dealer does not get Blackjack, then the player loses their insurance bet and the outcome of their initial bet is determined by the total of the cards they are holding vs. the dealer&apos;s cards.</p> <p><strong>Splitting</p></strong> <p>If a player is dealt two cards of the same value (including two of the same face cards), they are entitled to split the cards and double their initial bet.</p> <p>If you split a hand, Blackjack (3:2) <strong>cannot</strong> be called on that hand &ndash; a winning hand in this situation will be paid at even odds (1:1).</p> <p><strong>Only one split is allowed.</p></strong> <p>The player will now be playing two hands of Blackjack, one at a time. The first hand is dealt a second card. The player must decide whether they would like to <strong>Stand, Double</strong> or take another card by pressing <strong>Hit</strong>. Once the player has finished the first hand, they must move onto the second, repeating the same process. After the player is satisfied with both hands it is the dealer&apos;s turn. The dealer will now reveal their other card and take additional cards until they have a total of 17 or more.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: The player cannot <strong>Hit</strong> on split aces. The dealer deals a second card only for each hand.</p> <p><strong>Double</p></strong> <p>The player may double their bet after viewing their initial two cards. They will then only be allowed one additional hit to complete their hand. It is also possible to Double after a Split, except after splitting two aces.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Min/Max sign indicates the minimum and maximum bet per hand.</p> <br>Last updated 27/04/2017.
